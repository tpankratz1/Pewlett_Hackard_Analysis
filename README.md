# Pewlett Hackard Analysis

## Overview
As part of planning at Pewlett Hackard (PH), management has asked for experts to look at data in various databases to determine the number of retiring employees, per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. It will require SQL queries to be run. This report summarizes the analysis and helps prepare PH leadership for how to best plan for a large number of current employees who will soon reach retirement age.

## Results
### The number of retiring employees by title
- Through the query and analysis work, it's become clear that there will be many employees retiring soon, with a large percentage having senior-level titles such as Senior Engineer (25,916: 35.7% of the total) and Senior Staff (24,926: 34.4% of the total). For all of the titles, see *Retiring employees by title*, below.

##### *Table*

With 72,458 total employees soon to retire, a calculation was done to determine the ratio of mentors to new hires, by title. This will give a better understanding of the opportunities and gaps for mentoring:
- Staff: 7,636/427 = 17:1 ratio (IE, 17 new Staff positions per mentor)
- Senior Engineer: 25,916/409 = 63:1 ratio
- Senior Staff: 24,926/297 = 83:1 ratio
- Engineer: 9,285/292 = 31:1 ratio
- Technique Leader: 3,603/77 = 46:1 ratio
- Assistant Engineer: 1,090/47 = 23:1 ratio
- Manager: 2/0 = No managers available to mentor
